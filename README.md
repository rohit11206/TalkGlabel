# TalkGlabel

TalkGlabel is a peer-to-peer video calling web application that enables users to connect in real time from the comfort of their homes. Developed primarily to explore and learn new web technologies, this project showcases real-time video streaming, room management, and seamless peer-to-peer communication using **Socket.IO**, **React**, and **Node.js**.

## Features
- **Room Management**: Users enter a room ID to join a specific room, allowing multiple users with the same ID to connect in one space.
- **Peer-to-Peer Video Calling**: Real-time video communication between users.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Supports video streaming and signaling via Socket.IO for a responsive and low-latency experience.

## Project Purpose
TalkGlabel was built as a learning project to explore web development technologies such as React, Node.js, and WebRTC. Additionally, it provides a simple and convenient way for people to connect and have conversations from their homes.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For the frontend UI, making the app dynamic and responsive.
- **React Router DOM**: Manages the applicationâ€™s navigation.
- **Node.js**: Powers the backend server and handles API requests.
- **Socket.IO**: Enables real-time, bidirectional communication for video calls.
- **Socket.IO Client**: Connects the frontend to the Socket.IO server for signaling.
- **Nodemon**: Helps during development by automatically restarting the server on file changes.
